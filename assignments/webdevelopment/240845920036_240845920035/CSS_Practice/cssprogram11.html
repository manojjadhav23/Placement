          <p>Roronoa Zoro,[20] also known as "Pirate Hunter" Zoro,[9] is a main combatant of the Straw Hat Pirates, one of
            their two swordsmen, one of the Senior Officers of the Straw Hat Grand Fleet,[4] and is publicly recognized as
            the right-hand man and number two of his crew's captain Monkey D. Luffy.[21][22][23][24] Formerly a bounty
            hunter,[6] he is the second member of Luffy's crew and the first to join it, doing so in the Romance Dawn
            Arc.[2] Born in the East Blue, Zoro is the</p>
    
        <p>Born in the East Blue, Zoro is the son of Tera and Roronoa Arashi, the grandson of Shimotsuki Furiko and Roronoa
            Pinzoro, and the grandnephew of Shimotsuki Ushimaru, making him a descendant of both the Shimotsuki Family of
            Wano Country and the legendary samurai, Shimotsuki Ryuma.[3][11] As a master of Three Sword Style, a
            swordsmanship style which he created during his childhood training in Shimotsuki Village, Zoro is one of the
            three most powerful combatants of the Straw Hats, alongside Luffy and Sanji, who are referred to as the "Monster
            Trio".[25][26] His dream is to become the greatest swordsman in the world, in order to honor a promise he made
            to his deceased childhood friend and distant cousin Kuina.[27]</p>
        <p>In addition to his infamy as one of the Straw Hats and as a former bounty hunter, his sizeable bounty upon
            arriving at the Sabaody Archipelago caused Zoro, along with Luffy to be included among the eleven "Super
            Rookies", pirates who simultaneously reached the Red Line with bounties of over Beli100,000,000 shortly before
            the Summit War.[28] He, the other ten Super Rookies, and Marshall D. Teach would go on to be referred to as the
            "Worst Generation."[29]</p>
