    <p>Roronoa Zoro,[20] also known as "Pirate Hunter" Zoro,[9] is a main combatant of the Straw Hat Pirates, one of
        their two swordsmen, one of the Senior Officers of the Straw Hat Grand Fleet,[4] and is publicly recognized as
        the right-hand man and number two of his crew's captain Monkey D. Luffy.[21][22][23][24] Formerly a bounty
        hunter,[6] he is the second member of Luffy's crew and the first to join it, doing so in the Romance Dawn
        Arc.[2]

    <p>Born in the East Blue, Zoro is the son of Tera and Roronoa Arashi, the grandson of Shimotsuki Furiko and Roronoa
        Pinzoro, and the grandnephew of Shimotsuki Ushimaru, making him a descendant of both the Shimotsuki Family of
        Wano Country and the legendary samurai, Shimotsuki Ryuma.[3][11] As a master of Three Sword Style, a
        swordsmanship style which he created during his childhood training in Shimotsuki Village, Zoro is one of the
        three most powerful combatants of the Straw Hats, alongside Luffy and Sanji, who are referred to as the "Monster
        Trio".[25][26] His dream is to become the greatest swordsman in the world, in order to honor a promise he made
        to his deceased childhood friend and distant cousin Kuina.[27]</p>
    <p>In addition to his infamy as one of the Straw Hats and as a former bounty hunter, his sizeable bounty upon
        arriving at the Sabaody Archipelago caused Zoro, along with Luffy to be included among the eleven "Super
        Rookies", pirates who simultaneously reached the Red Line with bounties of over Beli100,000,000 shortly before
        the Summit War.[28] He, the other ten Super Rookies, and Marshall D. Teach would go on to be referred to as the
        "Worst Generation."[29]</p>
