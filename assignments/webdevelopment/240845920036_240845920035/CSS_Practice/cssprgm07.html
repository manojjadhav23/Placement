        The tiger (Panthera tigris) is a member of the genus Panthera and the largest living cat species native to Asia.
        It has a powerful, muscular body with a large head and paws, a long tail and orange fur with black, mostly
        vertical stripes. It is traditionally classified into nine recent subspecies, though some recognise only two
        subspecies, mainland Asian tigers and the island tigers of the Sunda Islands.
