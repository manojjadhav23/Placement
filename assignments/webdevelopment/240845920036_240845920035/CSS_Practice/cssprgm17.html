        <p>Surrealism is turning 100 years old, marking the publication of The Surrealist Manifesto by poet and critic André Breton in October 1924. The art and literary movement aimed to reunite conscious and unconscious realms so completely that dream and fantasy would be joined to the everyday rational world. The Surrealists came up with many methods to unlock their unconscious imagination, creating some of the 20th century’s most fantastical, disturbing, and humorous pieces of art and writing.</p>
        <p>The United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, commonly known as the United Kingdom (UK) or Britain,[m] is a country in Northwestern Europe, off the coast of the continental mainland.[21][22] It comprises England, Scotland, Wales, and Northern Ireland.[n][23] The UK includes the island of Great Britain, the north-eastern part of the island of Ireland, and most of the smaller islands within the British Isles, a total area of 94,354 square miles (244,376 km2).[f][12][24] Northern Ireland shares a land border with the Republic of Ireland; otherwise, the United Kingdom is surrounded by the Atlantic Ocean, the North Sea, the English Channel, the Celtic Sea, and the Irish Sea. The country had an estimated population of nearly 67.6 million people in 2022.[13] The capital and largest city of both England and the United Kingdom is London, whose wider metropolitan area is the largest in Western Europe, with a population of 14.9 million.[25] The cities of Edinburgh, Cardiff, and Belfast are the national capitals of Scotland, Wales, and Northern Ireland, respectively.</p>
